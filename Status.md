### Iteration One

- [x] Character, when created, has health 1000 
- [x] Character, when created, has level 1 
- [x] Character, when created, is alive 
- [x] Character can deal damage to another character, and damage is extracted from health
- [x] When damage exceeds current health, health becomes 0 and character dies
- [x] Dead characters cannot be healed
- [x] Healing cannot raise health above 1000

### Iteration One Prime

This is out of scope of the initial exercise, but I added a few things:

- [x] Damage depends on a D20 dice
- [x] Normal damage is 15 times the dice roll
- [x] Critical hit damage (dice roll 20) is double the normal
- [x] Critical miss damage (dice roll 1) is 0
- [x] Additional effects can be triggered by critical hit and critical miss so make the info available
